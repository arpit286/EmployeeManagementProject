# EmployeeManagementProject
This project was made by me during my final year of Computer Engineering Rollno. 05. I was assigned this project for recruitment purpose. 
In this project I have used Python Flask as the pillar of my application. In this project we can perform simple CRUD operations 
such as Insert, update, delete, search and assign employee Designations to the new user. I also added Login and Signup for every 
visitor. During the development of the project I have taken help from the https://scotch.io/@mbithenzomo as the referance and help.
This project taught me the implimentation of Flask in Python using HTML and CSSS to create VIEWS that I used in dashboard development 
as well as implimenting backend!
